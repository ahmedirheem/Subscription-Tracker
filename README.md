### ðŸ“¦ Subscription Tracker API

The Subscription Tracker is a RESTful API built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** that allows users to manage and track their subscriptions. It includes features like user registration, login, and secure session handling using JWT. Users can add, update, delete, and view their active subscriptions, helping them stay on top of recurring payments and avoid unexpected charges.

Additionally, the API uses **Nodemailer** to automatically send email reminders to users before their subscription **renewal dates**, ensuring they never miss an important renewal.
